# conFib
This React-frontended app provides a user interface which asks the user to input their desired length of the Fibonacci Sequence, and then communicates with a Go-lang backend through a websocket to use its ultra-fast concurrency and calculate the sequence in real time, then return the output back to the frontend. Also containerized through Docker.
